### Other
- [**breaking**] Upgrade near primitive crates version to 0.17.0 ([#126](https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/126))

## [0.5.1] - 2023-03-22

- Updated `borsh` to `0.10.2`. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/124>

## [0.5.0] - 2023-02-24

### Added

- `ApiKey::new` now accepts byte arrays and byte slices. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/119>
- `Authorization::bearer` method for token-authenticated requests. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/121>
- `ApiKey::as_bytes` returns a byte slice of the key without utf-8 validation. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/119>

### Changed

- Updated nearcore dependencies to `0.16.0`, which now requires a MSRV of `1.67.1`. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/122>
- `ApiKey::new` no longer requres the input of a valid UUID. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/119>

- Updated other dependencies, with some general improvements. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/111>
- Added `rustls-tls` feature flag to enable `rustls` as an alternative to `native-tls`. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/103>
- Switched to using `log::debug!` instead of `log::info!` for debug logging. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/107>

- Implemented workaround for partially serialized server responses. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/29>
- Dropped base64 API token support in favor of a generic key-value approach. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/commit/dd7761b51e1775350be1782370aa22c0b0fe98d7>
- Added examples to repo. <https://github.com/near/near-jsonrpc-client-rs/pull/32>
